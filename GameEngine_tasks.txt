Game Engine tasks:
- transform.position should return world location, not position relative to parent
- modifying transform amtrices should be based for world relation, not based on parent transform matrix
- Create bounding boxes for each child of the object. The parent bounding box needs to resize based on the childs bounding box vertices positions.
- write proper formula for generating camera frustrum planes.
- Apply frustrum culling for each child recursively based on parent bounding box.
- Find a way to visualize frustrum culling working, maybe using 2 cameras?
- Make BSP algorithm.
- Create and load scene for BSP demo.
